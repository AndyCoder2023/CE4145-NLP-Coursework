An NLP system is required for this objective to find and narrow down the dataset to pinpoint the algorithm that works the best. By implementing an NLP system there can be strong analysis on the dataset to find the correct criteria. The data will be pre-processed to allow data to not be missed or inconsistent data retrieval.

        "Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) has the capability to learn a non - linear function that is used to separate data. All the layers in a multi-layer perceptron are closely connected. Multiple hidden layers are also possible. Multilayer perceptron's have an input layer, hidden layer, and an output layer. There is also a requirement of a numerical vector in the input layer. The number of indexes in a vector will be the size of input layer. Hidden layer is used to connect input and output layer by using weights & biases. There needs to be an activation function in a hidden layer, but it is usually different on each hidden layer. The output layer is dependent on the final activation function but normally softmax is used in classification. The output layer consists of a vector of probabilities that have the same length of the number of classes.  \n",
