        "The two algorithms that will implemented will consist of Convolutional Neural Network and Siamese Neural Network. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) will have a dense layer which has the convolution with max pooling layers. Will we able to summarise the images of the movies that appear the most to gather what movie is most popular by the number of images appearing. In the convolution layer of the CNN there will be neurons that can detect small parts of the image to determine what the image is showing. For the max pooling layer this will be at the output of the convolution layer. A pooling operation will be used to summarise a feature map. Subsampling will be used to make the images smaller to give the network lesser parameters for better computation. The cnn will work by a series of steps which are as follows: Convolution, max pooling, convolution, max pooling, and then the final step which is flatten.\n",
