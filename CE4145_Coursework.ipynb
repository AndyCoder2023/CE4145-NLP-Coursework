An NLP system is required for this objective to find and narrow down the dataset to pin point the algorithm that works the best. By implementing an NLP system there can be strong analysis on the dataset to find the correct criteria. The data will be pre processed to allow data to not be missed or inconsistent data retrieval.

        "Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP) is able to learn a non - linear function that is used to seperate data. All the layers in a multi layer perceptron are closely connected. Multiple hidden layers are also possible. Multilayer perceptrons have an input layer, hidden layer, and an output layer. For the input layer there needs to be a numerical vector. The number of indexes in a vector will be the size of input layer. Hidden layer is used to connect input and output layer by using weights & biases. There is an activation function in the hidden layer but it is usually different on each hidden layer. The output layer is dependant on the final activation function but normally softmax is used in classification. The ouput layer consists of a vector of probabilities that have the same length of the number of classes.\n",

Instances are ranked by similarity to query after the similarity calculation."
